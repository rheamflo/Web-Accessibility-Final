        <p>
            As I continue preparing for my career in web design and development, I've come to realize that accessibility isn't just a technical 
            requirement or something you add at the very end of a project. For me, it has become much more personal. As technology continues to grow and reach more users, 
            it's important to make sure that all kinds of people are able to use and benefit from it. Learning about WCAG, ARIA, and accessible coding practices has 
            completely changed how I think about building websites, especially knowing that laws like the ADA and Section 504 exist to protect 
            equal access through reasonable accommodations and effective communication.
        </p>
        <p>
            Accessibility matters to me because coding has become something I'm genuinely proud of. When I first started learning to code, it felt intimidating, 
            but over time it became empowering. Being able to build a website from scratch and watch it come to life is incredibly rewarding, especially knowing that 
            real people will use what I create. When a website is accessible, users gain independence and confidence. They can complete tasks without frustration or needing 
            extra help. When it isn't accessible, the harm can be real, even if it isn't always obvious. It can leave users feeling discouraged or excluded in spaces that are meant to be universal.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I've learned more about accessibility, I've started noticing how often it's overlooked online. Most of the time, it isn't because people don't care. 
            It's because accessibility isn't prioritized early or fully understood. That realization stuck with me and helped me see that accessible design isn't about being
            perfect. It's about intention and asking who might be excluded by a design choice and being willing to adjust. This mindset has made me a more thoughtful 
            designer and developer, and it also applies to ethical considerations around AI and accessibility, where bias and automation can easily create new barriers if inclusion isn't considered from the start.
        </p>
        <p>
            Accessibility also connects closely to my values. The internet plays a huge role in education, work, healthcare, and social connection. When digital spaces aren't accessible, 
            they can make people feel invisible or forgotten. Hearing from our guest speakers, who shared their own experiences navigating the web using assistive technologies, made this even more real.
            Their stories reminded me that accessibility is not abstract. It directly affects how people move through the digital world every day.
        </p>
        <p>
            Looking ahead, I hope to be someone who actively advocates for accessibility on the teams I work with. I want to be the person who checks contrast, 
            tests keyboard navigation, and thinks about screen reader users, even when no one else brings it up. I know I won't get everything right, but I'm 
            committed to learning and improving. At the end of the day, accessibility is one of the most meaningful ways I can combine coding with empathy, 
            and that's the kind of designer and developer I want to be.
        </p>
